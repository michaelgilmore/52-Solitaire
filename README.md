# 52!Solitaire

A Solitaire game made with Flutter. This is for me to avoid ads and to be able 
to do some analysis of the games I play. This is also a great test bed for 
functionality that I may want to implement in other projects.

## Installing on the phone

1. Turn on Wireless Debugging in settings on the phone.
2. In Android Studio, using the search at the top right, search for "Pair Devices Using Wi-Fi".
3. Back on the phone click "Pair device with QR code".
4. Scan the QR code on the computer screen.
NOTE: This may not work if you have updates to install in Android Studio.
